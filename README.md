# Birdwatch AI

**Birdwatch AI** is a Python-based application designed to interface with a live video feedâ€”typically from an outdoor IP cameraâ€”enabling remote control, intelligent monitoring, and species identification.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- ðŸ“· **Live Camera Integration**  
  Receives and displays a live video stream from a connected **Reolink E1 Outdoor SE PoE** camera.

- ðŸŽ® **Camera Control**  
  Allows pan/tilt/zoom (PTZ) control through a web browser interface or a universal controller.

- ðŸ§  **AI-Powered Image Recognition**  
  Periodically captures snapshots and uses AI to detect and identify objects (e.g., birds, animals).

- ðŸ”” **Smart Alerts & Reporting**  
  Triggers alerts or logs sightings based on recognized species or movement.

## ðŸ’» Hardware

- **Raspberry Pi 5**  
  Primary computing device running the Python application and AI inference.

- **Reolink E1 Outdoor SE PoE**  
  IP camera with pan, tilt, and zoom support, connected via Ethernet.
